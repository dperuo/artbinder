# Performance Improvements:
- Move `jquery.common.js` into a `<script>` tag at the bottom of the html document. This will speed up page rendering, especially on mobile devices.
- Minify and concatenate your JavaScript. Serve one file containing all your scripts. This will speed up page rendering and reduce server calls.
- Minify and concatenate your CSS. Serve one file containing all your styles. This will speed up page rendering and reduce server calls.
- Serve 3rd-party libraries from an external CDN. This will speed up page rendering.
- Prefetch DNS records using `<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="#">`. This will speed up page rendering.
- Serve scaled images using `<srcset>` or media queries. This could cut data transfter by up to 73%.

# Project Structure
- Angular best practice recommends seperating controllers, directives and services into seperate files. One controller, directive or service per file.
